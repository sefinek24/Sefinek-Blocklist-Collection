# üìù Information
Here are the files containing templates for the blocklist, which then go through conversions to various formats by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/tree/main/.github/workflows).

## Which files can I edit?
Files with the `.fork` prefix (e.g., `KADhosts.fork.txt`) will be automatically overwritten by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/tree/main/.github/workflows) and should not be modified!

## False positives
If you encounter any false positives, create a new [Pull request](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/pulls) and add an exception to the whitelist located at [`whitelist/default.txt`](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/blob/main/whitelists/main.txt).

## Pull Requests
Generally, I am open to all changes. I would be happy if you created a new [Pull request](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/pulls) with your changes! Any help in developing this repository is welcome. Have fun!
