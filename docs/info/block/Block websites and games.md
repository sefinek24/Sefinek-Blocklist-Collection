Blocking access to specific domains can be an effective way to prevent users on your network from accessing certain websites, but it's important to keep in mind that it may not completely prevent access to the websites, as they may still be accessible through other domains or IP addresses.
Therefore, it is crucial to use additional strategies to address concerns about inappropriate content, cyberbullying, or other online safety issues.

Furthermore, it's always a good idea to educate yourself and others about online safety and responsible internet use, as this will help promote a safe and healthy online environment.
Using content filters and parental controls can also be helpful in promoting online safety.
Additionally, monitoring internet activity can help identify potential issues and allow for prompt action to be taken.
