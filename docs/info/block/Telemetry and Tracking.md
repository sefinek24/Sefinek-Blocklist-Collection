Blocking these domains can improve online safety and help protect your privacy.

## 🌍 Telemetry Domains
Telemetry domains are websites that collect data about the performance and usage of software applications.
By blocking these domains with Pi-hole, you can prevent your data from being shared with the software developer or third-party companies without your consent.

## 🕵️ Tracking Domains
Tracking domains are used by websites and advertisers to collect data on users' online behavior, which is then used to create targeted advertisements and personalize content.
Blocking these domains with Pi-hole can help protect your online privacy by preventing your activity from being monitored.
