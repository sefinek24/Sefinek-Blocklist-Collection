## 🤔 Why should I block TikTok?
TikTok is a social media platform that has gained immense popularity, especially among younger generations, in recent years.
It enables users to create short videos, usually around 15 seconds long, with a variety of effects, filters, and music.
With over 1 billion active users, TikTok has become one of the most downloaded apps in the world.

However, TikTok has also faced criticism over privacy and security concerns.
In 2020, the app was banned in India due to national security concerns, and there were similar considerations by the US government.

Blocking TikTok in the home network using tools like Pi-hole may be a good idea for several reasons.
One major concern is the amount of data TikTok collects from its users, including location, browsing history, and device information.
This data may be used for targeted advertising, among other purposes.

There have also been reports of TikTok sending data to servers in China, raising concerns about potential access by the Chinese government.
While TikTok has denied these claims and stated that it stores user data in the US and Singapore, concerns about how the company handles user data persist.

For instance, in July 2020, TikTok was found to be accessing data on users' clipboards on iOS devices, potentially enabling the app to see and store sensitive information like passwords.
In August 2020, it was reported that the app was collecting biometric data from users without their consent, including facial recognition patterns and voiceprints.

In conclusion, while TikTok is an entertaining app, its privacy and security practices raise serious concerns.
Blocking TikTok on the home network using tools like Pi-hole can help protect user data and prevent sensitive information from being shared with the app's servers.
