# 📝 Information
I use this list every day on my Pi-hole (Raspberry Pi 4 B & HP T630), and I haven't encountered any false positives.
If I do encounter a false positive or misleading block, I will report it immediately to the list creator or update the list myself if it is mine.
Some of the blocklists have been downloaded from other creators who were less interested in the repositories with blocklists, and I have [modified](Modified%20lists.md) them to remove false alarms and similar issues.

You can also use the list generator on [my website](https://sefinek.net). You will be able to select what specifically should be blocked.
Just like with the standard list, you can be assured that every link within the list will work.

It's important to regularly check this repository for updates and potential changes. You can also access my official CDN by clicking on [this link](https://cdn.sefinek.net).
However, please note that while this blocklist can improve your privacy and security, it may also unintentionally block legitimate content or services.
Therefore, please use it at your own risk.
