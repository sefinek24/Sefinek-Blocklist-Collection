## 📰 Identifying and Blocking Fake News Domains
Fake news domains refer to websites that deliberately publish false or misleading information with the aim of manipulating public opinion or generating traffic for their own gain.
They pose a significant challenge as they can spread misinformation on crucial issues and undermine trust in legitimate sources of information.

To safeguard yourself or others against the adverse effects of fake news, it is essential to consider blocking access to these websites.
This can be achieved using tools such as Pi-hole, which is capable of blocking particular domains from being accessed on your network.
By incorporating a list of fake news domains into Pi-hole, you can prevent users on your network from accessing these sites and potentially being deceived by their content.

It's important to note that while the URLs provided can be used to block domains on Pi-hole, this list may not be exhaustive.
These URLs are linked to specific domains that you may opt to block on your network to enhance online safety and mitigate potential risks.
Please consider this list as a reference and implement additional measures to further enhance online safety.

Here's an example URL with a list of domains:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marktron/fakenews/master/fakenews

While blocking these domains can be an effective way to limit exposure to fake news content, it's equally essential to educate yourself on how to identify and avoid fake news.
